# Event/Meet-Up Application
This is a solo full-stack project where I designed a small event/meet-up application with a focus on backend user authentication and authorization. As a user, you can create and search for events; as admin - delete events and users. The frontend is created with React.js using Vite and JavaScript. On the server side, I use Java and Spring Security.
